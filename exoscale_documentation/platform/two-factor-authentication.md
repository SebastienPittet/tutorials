Two-step verification lets you protect your account in a strong way.

With 2-step verification enabled, logging in to your account works a bit
differently: you enter your password and a secure code generated by your mobile
device. Stealing your password isn't enough for an attacker to get access to
your Exoscale account.

This method combines the security of something you know (your password) and
something you have (your mobile device that generates secure codes).

## Set up
From the `ACCOUNT` menu, go to `PROFILE` and then click on the
`Password and Security` tab.

* Click on `Set up 2-step verification`.
* Enter your Account password
* Scan the QR code with your device's authenticator app, or enter the code in the app
* Your app will give you another code to enter in the form
* Click `SUBMIT` and you should be all set

If you don't have an authenticator yet,
[you can find a list of compatible apps for your device here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm#Client_implementations)
