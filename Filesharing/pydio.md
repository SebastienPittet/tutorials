This guide installs Pydio on exoscale.

## Manual installation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Add a the official Pydio repository to your instance:

    sudo vi /etc/sources.list.d/pydio.list

And copy the following contents:

    deb http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt stable main
    deb-src http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/apt stable main

Add the repository key to your instance:

    wget -O - http://dl.ajaxplorer.info/repos/charles@ajaxplorer.info.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

Update and then install Pydio:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install pydio

Push a default Apache2 configuration

    sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pydio/apache2.sample.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/pydio.conf

Install the mcrypt library required for all security features of Pydio

    sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt php5-sqlite
    sudo php5enmod mcrypt

And restart Apache

    sudo service apache2 restart

## Configure your Pydio instance

Connect to your freshly installed Pydio with http://<instance IP>/pydio

Pydio will check all your installation prerequisites and probably
throw some warnings because our default configuration does not run
over SSL. You can skip this by clicking on `click here to continue to Pydio`.

Pydio will then launch the setup wizard and ask about language,
admin name, username and password. 

Use the with database mode and then select sqlite and finish the wizard.
